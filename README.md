# Line-Grapher
C# windows form application that generates linear graphs using a set of x and y coordinates

Overview: Line Grapher is a C# windows form application that generates linear graphs using a set of x and y coordinates on the fly. You also have the option to save coordinate data sets into a text file with a specified file name. The application also comes with a statistics section that shows the min/max of the graph.

Disclaimer: Incorrect input of data (i.e. strings, booleans, etc) that are not integers or doubles may result in an application crash. Line grapher was not developed for commercial purposes but was created to serve the developer's current needs. Therefore the application lacks a robust quality or lacks input validation techniques. Please use with caution! Thank you.
